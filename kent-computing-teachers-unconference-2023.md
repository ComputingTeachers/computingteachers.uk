Hi All,

* I want to gather Computing Teachers in Kent for an informal gathering and networking event
* Monday 23rd October 2023 - Half Term - 10:00 to 13:00
* I've booked a room on CCCU campus [canterbury.ac.uk Lg14](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/campusmaps/2ea30af3d92c45ee851a1e01/details/39667fd284324e47844bbe6e) [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.2795&mlon=1.0885#map=15/51.2795/1.0885) [what3words.com/tour.sleep.showed](https://what3words.com/tour.sleep.showed)

* I intend this to feel like an un-conference, where people can talk/present ideas for 10min with a low bar (no powerpoint nonsense)
    * Examples:
        * A teacher could talk about how they deliver a "Networks" module to GCSE and talk about the approach
        * Specifically asking the room what long term digital literacy people put in place in year 7 and 8 to help with GCSE's later
        * How your school is including/encouraging wider groups to take up Computing
* I'm hoping that by booking the space and timeboxing the event we can trial the ideas and see what happens
* I would love to see a range of our wider community there
    * Recent PGCE/SD trainees, mentors, old veterans
* Feel free to send this invite to any other Computing teachers across the county
* Let me know if you're interested by popping me a 'hello' email - I would love to hear from you.

See you soon
