Hi All,

* We want to gather Computing Teachers in Kent for an informal gathering and networking event
* Monday 26rd May 2025 - Half Term - 10:00 to 14:00
* EKC Dover College has generously donated space for the event  [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=#map=19/51.128215/1.312295) [what3words.com/script.riots.token](https://what3words.com/script.riots.token)

* This is an un-conference, where people can talk/present ideas for 10min with a low bar (no powerpoint nonsense)
    * Examples:
        * A teacher could talk about how they deliver a "Networks" module to GCSE and talk about the approach
        * Specifically asking the room what long term digital literacy people put in place in year 7 and 8 to help with GCSE's later
        * How your school is including/encouraging wider groups to take up Computing
* We are hoping that by booking the space and time-boxing the event we can trial the ideas and see what happens
* We would love to see a range of our wider community there
    * Recent PGCE/SD trainees, ECT's, mentors, old veterans
* Feel free to send this invite to any other Computing teachers across the county
* RSPV if you're interested by popping us a 'hello' email - we would love to hear from you

See you soon
